The dependency nokogiri (>= 1.6.8) will be unused by any of the platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing for java but the dependency is only for ruby, x86-mswin32, mswin64, x86-mingw32, x64-mingw32. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-platform ruby x86-mswin32 mswin64 x86-mingw32 x64-mingw32`.
