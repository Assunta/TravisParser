Actual error raised was #<RuntimeError: Cookbook depends on itself in cookbook foo, please remove the this unnecessary self-dependency>. Instead consider providing a specific error class or message.

..................................................*...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................WARNING: Using the `raise_error` matcher without providing a specific error or message risks false positives, since `raise_error` will match when Ruby raises a `NoMethodError`, `NameError` or `ArgumentError`, potentially allowing the expectation to pass without even executing the method you are intending to call. Actual error raised was #<NoMethodError: undefined method `path' for Chef::Resource::Execute>. Instead consider providing a specific error class or message. This message can be suppressed by setting: `RSpec::Expectations.configuration.on_potential_false_positives = :nothing`.
